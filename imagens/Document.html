                </p><h3>Arthur Morgan</h3> is a cold, brooding outlaw who often resorts to violence and has very few qualms
                about
                killing. At his worst Arthur could be extremely ruthless and completely unsympathetic to the people he
                hurts. Despite being capable of committing such violence, Arthur does have a playful side to his
                personality that comes out around those he is friendly with. He isn't above joking or employing sarcasm
                with his friends. Notably Arthur was kind and polite to John Marston's then-four-year-old son, Jack,
                having a gentle demeanor around the young boy in contrast to his threatening persona. Despite his
                ability to
                commit great acts of violence Arthur has his own moral code and doesn't believe in what he deems as
                unnecessary killing, especially if it endangers himself or those he cares about. Dutch also raised
                Arthur to
                believe that revenge is a fruitless endeavor. It seems that Arthur strictly believes that violence
                should be
                cold, necessary and without feeling, never out of personal enjoyment or without reason.

                Arthur cannot be bought, bullied or intimidated, regardless of an antagonist's size, strength, wealth or
                power. He is fully self-aware of his imposing nature and the effect that his own force of intimidation
                can
                have on others. Although Arthur demonstrates time after time that he fears no man, he does fear for the
                safety of those he cares about. Supremely confident in his ability to handle any situation or overcome
                any
                adversary, Arthur rarely shows any hesitation and will engage in combat even when outnumbered. Despite
                Arthur's usual bravery and calm demeanor, he does display a rare moment of fear when he confides in
                Sister
                Calderón, revealing to her that he is afraid of his own impending death as a result of his terminal
                illness.

                <p>
                </p><h3>John Marston</h3> is also a fairly serious individual with very little patience for the
                eccentricities of both life and the various people he meets during the events of Red Dead Redemption. He
                frequently threatens Irish into sobering up so as to be of some use to him, and he is clearly
                disturbed/disgusted by Seth's habitual grave robbing. However, he is not above employing sarcasm in
                conversation with certain characters, particularly those he sees as exhibiting hypocrisy, which can be
                seen in his interactions with both Abraham Reyes and Agustin Allende. John is also shown assisting both
                sides of the revolution in Mexico, suggesting he is willing to be morality apathetic to save his family.

                He greatly respects women and refuses to commit adultery yet can be quick to anger and never seems to
                feel guilty or remorseful about the deaths he's caused both past and present. Despite Dutch leaving him
                for dead and devolving to a deranged maniac, John still holds respect for him as a former father figure
                in his life. The familial bond created when Dutch took in an orphaned teenage John is still somewhat
                evident, as John is noticeably reluctant to kill Dutch when given the chance; even years after his time
                in the gang, John still has some of Dutch's more progressive, less violent philosophical beliefs, such
                as viewing modern society to be deeply unfair and having a low opinion of the government. However, John
                does seem to have matured since his criminal days and is unbending in his desire to live out the rest of
                his life with his family.

                John is also extremely polite to women, often calling Bonnie "Miss MacFarlane" despite her insistence
                that he call her "Bonnie." He also does anything possible to keep women safe, even pistol-whipping Irish
                to defend two nuns he was holding up. In contrast to his politeness to women, John is unafraid to take
                the moral high ground when dealing with less than reputable characters, like Irish with his alcoholism
                and Nigel West Dickens with his swindling of gullible people. John seems to be one of the only men who
                is loyal to his wife. He also seems to get irritated when someone mentions his wife's past rather than
                his own.<p></p>

                <p>
                </p><h3>Dutch V.D Linde</h3> himself is shown to be a merciless killer who justifies killing innocent people
                or lawmen as a way of combating the corruption of the federal government. Despite his brutal ways, Dutch
                is educated and, unlike many outlaws, genuinely believes he is committing these crimes for idealistic
                reasons rather than greed. His anti-government and pro-individualist idealism, combined with his natural
                charisma, attracted a following of people who had been downtrodden by the society they lived in. Several
                members of the gang were orphans, minorities, town drunks, former prostitutes and other lowlifes; people
                who had felt they had no purpose until they joined the gang and Dutch gave them one. This created a
                strong sense of unity within the gang and a great sense loyalty to Dutch.

                Despite at times being rather brutal in his methods, Dutch would often joke around with his fellow gang
                members and had a kind, playful disposition. He would often make motivational speeches to encourage the
                gang to come together in times of hardship while preaching that "loyalty" and "faith" were among the
                highest and most honorable tenets. Before Hosea's demise, he often consulted him and Arthur on important
                decisions, putting it to a discussion and vote between the three of them when deciding on the direction
                of the gang, demonstrating how much their opinions meant to him.

                Dutch employed a highly flexible command system within the gang. At the peak of his power, Dutch
                displayed genuine compassion for his fellow gang members and treated them as family members in a way
                that made them feel appreciated. He complimented them on their resilience and ability, thanked them for
                their loyalty and their work, and saw to it that they were supplied, fed, and sheltered. His generosity
                endeared him to new members, many of whom had known little but harshness, pain, and struggle. His
                capacity to believe in others and help them believe in themselves was in turn reciprocated. Although he
                demanded that members give loyalty and do their share for the gang as a whole, he also encouraged them
                to be themselves as well as to make use of their free time to optimize their own talents and skill sets.
                At his best, Dutch commanded a balanced brand of leadership that not only required followers to have
                structure and discipline but also allowed them to express freedom and individuality. He had utmost faith
                in his gang to overcome almost any situation regardless of the odds and regarded his most capable
                lieutenants, such as Arthur Morgan and John Marston, as his collective ace in the hole.<p></p>

                independent, and loves

                </p><h3>Charles Smith</h3> has been described as a quiet and reserved person, yet very competent in
                everything he takes part of, especially fights, to the extent that he is able to successfully compete
                with a flawless record in fighting tournaments such as in Saint Denis in 1907. He is very courageous and
                selfless, providing whatever help he could to the Wapiti Indian reservation, rescuing Captain Monroe and
                Eagle Flies from the US Army, and telling Sadie and John to run from Micah's men first while he would
                supposedly catch up later despite being critically wounded. He is nearly always calm, only showing
                visible happiness or anger on a few short occasions.

                Arguably the most honorable member of the gang, Charles is cool-headed and reluctant to kill; the
                continuing blood spilled by the gang is ultimately what causes him to become disillusioned with it and
                helping the Wapiti Indians instead. He disapproves of people who are nothing but vicious killers, such
                as his notable disdain for the Callander brothers and Micah. He is also compassionate towards wild
                animals and shows rare visible anger when encountering the poachers' killing bison for sport. He
                despises racism, throwing Micah to the ground instantly for calling him a redskin, and being visibly
                impressed by Dutch's fair treatment of all races. He is also shown to be thoughtful and kind, burying
                Susan and Arthur after discovering their bodies. In the case of Arthur, he buried him in a particularly
                picturesque spot with a decorated gravestone.

                Ultimately, he can be described as altruistic. He is quick to help anyone who has helped him or who is
                in need of help in spite of however bad his condition may be or how little benefit it may be to him. He
                teachers Arthur to use a bow while still wounded (in spite of Arthur's protests) to save the gang from
                certain starvation, proactively searches to reunite the German family (in spite of Arthur's protests
                again) and unconditionally helps John and Uncle construct the ranch at Beecher's Hope in 1907.<p></p>

        <hr>
        <hr>
        <section class="art1">
            <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 (stylized as Red Dead Redemption II) is a western-themed action-adventure video
                game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a
                prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption[4] and was released on October 26th, 2018[5] on PlayStation 4,
                Xbox One[6] and on November 5th, 2019 for PC.

                Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on the
                life of Arthur Morgan and his position in the notorious Van der Linde gang. The game follows the gang's
                decline as they are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton agents. The narrative revolves around
                the characters of Dutch van der Linde, John Marston and Micah Bell in addition to Morgan.

                Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in an open world consisting of five American regions, which the player can
                explore as they proceed with the story, and can be played through both third-person and first-person
                view. As Arthur Morgan, players can interact with the game world in several ways, including story
                missions, side quests, challenges, randomized events, and hunting. An Honor system, returning from the
                previous game, changes accordingly to the player's actions towards non-player characters.

                Upon release, Red Dead Redemption 2 received widespread universal acclaim; it was praised for its
                writing, themes, characterization, open-world design, visuals, realistic elements and attention to
                detail, though it also received criticism for its control scheme and the effect of realism on the
                gameplay. A commercial success, Red Dead Redemption 2 had the second-biggest launch in the history of
                entertainment (behind fellow Rockstar Games title Grand Theft Auto V), generating $725 million in sales
                from its opening weekend and shipping over 23 million copies in retail.</p>
